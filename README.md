# ML Sports Prediction Project

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the outcomes of various sports events. It is designed to be a comprehensive solution for sports predictions, with a focus on data processing, model training, and deployment.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Collects and processes data for training and predictions.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements various machine learning models to make predictions based on the input data.
- **Model Deployment**: The project is structured for easy deployment and prediction in a web-based environment.
- **Model Scaler**: Includes a scaler to normalize data and improve model performance.
- **Django Backend**: Uses Django for creating a web interface where users can interact with the prediction models.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
